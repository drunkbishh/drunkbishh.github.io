            <h2> How I arrived at my final questions:
            </h2>
            <p>
              For my CBA 2, I knew I wanted to do something related to chess. So I researched about the most effective chess openings. After careful consideration and guidance from my teachers and friends, I realised that this topic did not meet my requirements for my CBA 2 as it did not provide me with primary data. This is when I started looking at other subtopics related to chess. Therefore, I arrived at my final topic: chess vs. non-chess players; who is better at problem-solving?

            <h3>Hypothesisâ€‹:</h3>
            <p>
              For my hypothesis, I could go with 2 outcomes : 
              <h3>First one</h3>
              Students who play chess regularly will complete problem-solving puzzles faster and more accurately than those who do not."
              <h3>Second one</h3> 
              There will be no significant difference in problem-solving skills between chess players and non-chess players

      <p>
      1) Chess Skill Development: chess players develop specific problem-solving skills that differ from non-players.

      <br> </br>
      2) Understanding Puzzles: All participants have a similar comprehension of the logic puzzles and instructions.
      <br></br>
      3)Comparable Cognitive Abilities: Participants within the same age group have similar cognitive skills.
      <br></br> 
      4)Equal Motivation: All participants are equally motivated to perform well on the puzzles.
      <br></br>
      5)Environmental Consistency: The testing environment does not significantly influence participant performance.
      <br></br> 
      6)Puzzle Appropriateness: The complexity of the puzzles is suitable for the participants age and cognitive levels.
