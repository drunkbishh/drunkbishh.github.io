          <div class="items">
      <h3>Variables:</h3>
      <p>
      1) Cost of designing and opening
      <br> </br>
      2) Cost of equipment 
      <br> </br>
      3) Number of Custombers changing depending on seasonality and popularity  
      <br> </br> 
      4) Answers to my survey 
      <br> </br>
      5) Price of games, changing of price to play each game based on popularity
      <br> </br>
      6) The revenue generated from the games
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="items">
      <h3>Constants</h3>
      <p> 1)Location:<br></br>The location of the arcade is set to be permanent 
      <br></br>
      2) The classic arcade games:<br></br> Games would be added and removed based of popularity but somes would be classics that would stay constant
      <br></br>
      3)The insurance: The insurance plan and cost would stay the same
      <br></br>
       </p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="block5">
      
      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="block5-1">
      <p>
      1) Enough Market demand: There is enough market demand for an arcade otherwise there would be no need to open an arcade. 
      <br> </br>
      2) Permit and licences: I have all the permits and licences to open an arcade in Dublin, otherwise this project would be pointless.
      <br></br>
      3)Location: The location is optimal for attracting customers and an average amount of customers visit everyday as this would be important for calculating the revenue.
      <br></br> 
      4)There is an unlimted budget as finding the cost of opening and designng is a variable in this project.
      <br></br>
      5)The area and height of the arcade is 2000 sq. feet ( which is ≈ 185 m²) and 12 feet (which is ≈ 3.6m) respectively as that is the average area and height of a arcade in Dublin.
      <br></br> 
      6)The cost of each unit would be around €784 as that is the average cost of a arcade unit 
      <br></br>
      7)I would have all the I durance packages required as in case of any accident, I endure as few losses as possible.
