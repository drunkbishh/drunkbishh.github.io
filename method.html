<h1>1) Selection of participants</h1>
<p>I sent out a survey form asking people if they played chess and if they would like to be part of my research, I then selected  people who were willing to participate.
    Each category had 4 people.(Link to the survey in the appendix)
</p>
<h1>2) Puzzle selection</h1><p>I selected a series of logic grid puzzles, maze puzzles and riddles 
    I then asked each participant to complete the puzzles while I timed them.
    </p>
</div>
    <div class="items">
<h1>3) Accuracy and Time</h1>
<p>I measured the time it took for each participant to complete the maze puzzles and recored the accuracy and their problem solving apporaches to each question.</p> 
<h1> 4)Data Collection </h1>
<p>I recorded the data I collected in a word document and then analysed it to see patterns and find out the statistics. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="cards">
    <div class="items">
<h1>5) Comparision of Data</h1>
<p>I compared the data to see if the chess players performed better than the non-chess players. </p>
<h1> 6) Website creation</h2>
<p>I compiled all of my research into this website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="stuff">
<h1>Areas of further improvement</h1>
<p>1)  During the data collection phase, I could have managed my time more effectively.
     There were times when I had to rush to complete certain tasks. In future projects, I will
    aim to allocate more time for analysis and reflection.
    
     <br></br>
     2) Although I calculated basic statistics,
      I could improve my project by applying more advanced statistical tests to determine 
      whether the differences in performance between the two groups are statistically significant.
      This would add more depth to my analysis and conclusions.
      <br><br>
      3)  Most of my participants were from a similar age group and background. 
      I could improve by gathering data from a more diverse group to see if chess playing improves 
      problem-solving abilities across different demographics

</p>


<section3>
<h1>Things I would've done differently</h1> 
<p>1) I could have included a wider variety of logic puzzles with different levels of difficulty.
     This would allow me to see how participants perform under different types of cognitive challenges,
     which might reveal more about their problem-solving abilities.
    <br></br>
2) In some cases, the time it took participants to solve the puzzles might have
 been affected by external factors (e.g., distractions or anxiety). I could improve by ensuring 
 a more controlled environment to reduce the
 impact of these variables.
<br></br>
3) One area I could improve is increasing the number of participants. A larger sample size would make the 
data more reliable and provide a better representation of the population. With more participants,
 the differences between chess players and non-chess players might become clearer.</p>
