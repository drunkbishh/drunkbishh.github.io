<h3>The easy maze puzzles</h3>

<br></br> Non-chess players:   (26+16+14+11)/4
<br></br> 67/4 = 16.75 seconds
 <br></br> 12.5 < 16.75, Therefore the chess players are better than the non-chess players at the easy maze puzzle
 <br></br><h2>The median:The middle most value <br></br>The chess players<br></br> (12+7)/2 = 9.5 <br></br>The non- chess players<br></br>(11+14)/2=12.5</h2>

 <h2>Interquarile Range (IQR)</h2>
 <h4>7, 12, 15, 16</h4>

  <h4>  Q1 (First Quartile): This is the median of the lower half (7, 12). The median between these two is:
    
    𝑄1 =( 7 + 12)/ 2 = 9.5</h4>
   <h4> Q3 (Third Quartile): This is the median of the upper half (15, 16). The median between these two is:

    <h4> Calculating the IQR
    IQR= 𝑄3−𝑄1=15.5−9.5= 6

    <h4>

    Conclusion:
    The Interquartile Range (IQR) is 6 seconds, indicating that the middle 50% of the participants' times are spread out over 6 seconds.

    <h2>Outliers</h2>
<p>
    Lower Bound:Lower Bound=Q1−1.5×IQR=9.5−(1.5×6.0)=9.5−9=0.5
    <br></br>
Upper Bound:Upper Bound=Q3+1.5×IQR=15.5+(1.5×6.0)=15.5+9=24.5
<br></br>
Identifying Outliers: Any data point below the lower bound (0.5 seconds) or above the upper bound (24.5 seconds) would be considered an outlier.
<br></br>
Conclusion:
Since all the data points (7, 12, 15, and 16 seconds) fall within the range of 0.5 to 24.5 seconds, there are no outliers in this dataset.

<h5>Limits</h5>
<p>Small sample size which affects the reliability of your conclusions.
    Lack of participant diversity, limiting how broadly the results can be applied.
    Puzzle difficulty may have been too easy or too hard, influencing performance.
    External factors like distractions or different environments impacting the results.
    Time constraints limited data collection and analysis.
    Self-reporting errors if participants recorded their own times.
    Varying chess skill levels among participants, affecting comparisons.
    Puzzle selection may not perfectly represent the problem-solving skills gained from chess.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this study, I compared the problem-solving abilities of chess players and non-chess players 
    using logic grid puzzles. The results suggest that chess players
    , on average, solved the puzzles more quickly than non-chess players, indicating a
     potential link between chess experience and enhanced problem-solving skills. 
     However, given the small sample size and the potential impact of external factors such 
     
     as distractions and differing environments, these results should be interpreted with caution.

    While the data showed some clear trends, further research with a larger and more diverse 
    sample would be needed to confirm the findings. Additionally, using a broader range of
     puzzle types could provide a more complete picture of the cognitive benefits associated 
     with playing chess. Despite these limitations, the project highlights how strategic games 
     
     like chess may contribute to improved logical thinking and cognitive skills.
    
    In future studies, it would be valuable to explore whether different levels of chess
     experience yield varying effects on problem-solving ability, and to consider other 
     cognitive challenges that may be even more strongly influenced by chess play.</p>
